# IGRIS AGENT

**A personal operating system for single-operator business: a live web command
center that runs your company as a set of AI-assisted "departments."**

> IGRIS AGENT is a rebrand of the open-source FounderOS demo
> ([Bennettxai/FounderOS-DEMO](https://github.com/Bennettxai/FounderOS-DEMO)).

IGRIS AGENT turns the tabs, tools, and mental overhead of running a solo business
into one screen: unified comms, a client funnel, social growth, finances, a
knowledge graph, and a roster of named AI agents that each own a real job.

This repository is the **open-source demo build**. It ships seeded with
realistic placeholder data, so every page is alive out of the box with no
accounts, no API keys, and nothing to configure. It's the same system taught,
live, in the [Founder OS cohort](https://www.thefounderos.com); this repo lets
you explore and run it yourself.

## Quick start

Requires **Node 18+**.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # optional; only needed to wire live integrations
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:4100
```

A local SQLite database is **seeded with demo data on first run**, so every page
is populated immediately. No credentials are required to browse. Navigate with
the sidebar or the Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + K). Five themes ship, including
the Monolith default (white on black, color means status only); pick it from the
palette icon in the top bar.

```bash
npm run build && npm start   # production build
npm test                     # vitest suite
npm run typecheck            # tsc --noEmit
npm run seed                 # re-seed the demo DB (idempotent)
```

## What you're looking at

| Route | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Operator console: pulse row, connections strip, agent list, knowledge core |
| `/comms` | Unified inbox: email, Slack, WhatsApp, and dictation lanes in one feed |
| `/funnel` | Living client-journey flow: a left-to-right neural view and a radial acquisition wheel, both fullscreenable |
| `/social` | Growth dashboard: per-account follower charts, audience share, posting cadence |
| `/content` | Content pipeline and calendar |
| `/finances` | Income and expense charts, money-out views, expenses by category |
| `/agents` | The AI agent roster, each with a real `run()` and last-run state |
| `/tasks` | Task board fed by the agents |
| `/skills` | Reusable, schedulable agent skills |
| `/org` | Org hierarchy: operator, conductor, pillars, workers |
| `/brain` | The knowledge core and graph (see **Knowledge layer** below) |
| `/workflows` | Multi-step tool workflows |
| `/integrations` | Live connections board with honest status for every connector |
| `/analytics` | Real connector numbers and sparkline history |
| `/roadmap`, `/reference` | Phases and quarters, and the reference model |
| `/personas` | Persona templates that reskin the OS for other business types |

## Architecture: larp-first, real-ready

This is the load-bearing design rule. The demo looks alive because of rich
seeded data, but **every page and API route reads through a repository layer**
(never a raw query), and **every connector returns an honest status** (it never
fakes "connected"). Swapping seeded tables for live sources is a repo-level
change, not a rewrite.

- **`lib/data.ts`**: `getDb()` app singleton; seeds on first touch.
- **`lib/db.ts`**: `openDb()` plus typed repositories (`agents`, `departments`,
  `social`, `funnel`, `finances`, and more).
- **`lib/seed.ts`**: all seeded demo content lives here.
- **`lib/schemas.ts`**: Zod schemas validate every row on the way **out** of the
  DB, so bad data fails loud.
- **`lib/connectors/*`**: 20+ connector groups (email/IMAP, Slack, Stripe,
  Notion, calendar, CRM, social, and more). Each returns a typed
  `ConnectorStatus` of `connected`, `not_configured`, or `error`: always the
  truth, never a fake green light.
- **`lib/agents/*`**: every seeded agent maps one-to-one to a runtime agent with
  a real `run()`; runs persist and surface on `/agents`.

New data means a new repo method, a Zod schema, a seed entry, and a test. Keep
it that way.

## Knowledge layer: G-Brain

The `/brain` graph you see in the demo is the visible surface of G-Brain, the
knowledge system that powers the production build.

Plain **Markdown files are the source of truth**. They're chunked and embedded
into a vector store, so one store answers both **keyword** and **semantic**
queries (hybrid retrieval with reciprocal-rank fusion). If the vector backend is
unreachable, retrieval falls back to a local grep over the markdown: fewer
smarts, zero downtime. The demo ships a stub provider; the production provider
reads a live markdown store and a vector index.

Every agent queries that same store before it acts, so the OS carries one shared
memory instead of one per agent.

---

## The full plan (production)

The demo is self-contained (Next.js plus seeded SQLite). The production build
keeps the same repo-layer contract and swaps in real backends:

- **Hosting: [Railway](https://railway.app).** The Next.js app deploys as a
  Railway service; the seeded SQLite store is replaced by a managed database,
  and G-Brain retrieval runs as a companion service alongside it. Env vars are
  managed per environment.
- **Knowledge: G-Brain** becomes the live knowledge and memory layer behind
  `/brain` and every agent.
- **Connectors go live.** Because each connector already reports honest status,
  wiring a real source (IMAP inboxes, Slack, Stripe, Notion, a CRM, calendar,
  social) is just supplying credentials. The UI immediately reflects real state
  instead of seeded data.
- **Agents run for real.** Each agent's `run()` executes against the live
  connectors and the knowledge layer, on a schedule, with runs persisted.

Same interface you see in this demo, backed by your real business instead of
placeholder data.

## Project structure

```
app/                 Next.js App Router; one folder per view plus /api routes
components/          UI: dashboard sections, graphs, terminal primitives
lib/
  data.ts db.ts      repository layer plus app DB singleton
  seed.ts            all seeded demo content
  schemas.ts         Zod schemas (validate every DB/API boundary)
  connectors/        20+ honest-status integrations
  agents/            agent registry plus runtimes
  knowledge-graph.ts, memory-core.ts   brain graph plus memory model
scripts/             seed plus doc-generation scripts
tests/               vitest suite (one file per module)
```

---

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to
`.env.local` and fill in only what you want to wire up; everything else stays in
honest "not configured" mode. `.env.local` is gitignored.

**Never commit real keys.** The demo runs fully without any of them.

---

## Tech stack

- **Next.js 14** (App Router, server components) plus **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**: monochrome "Monolith" theme with pickable colorways
- **better-sqlite3**: seeded local store (WAL)
- **Zod**: schema validation at every boundary
- **Vitest**: test suite
- **Vercel AI SDK**: agent LLM calls
- **d3-force**, **lucide-react**, **simple-icons**: graph physics and iconography

---

## Testing

```bash
npm test          # run the full vitest suite
npm run typecheck # tsc --noEmit
```

Tests live in `tests/`, one file per module, using an in-memory SQLite pattern
so they never touch the seeded dev DB.

---

## Access control

Founder OS is a **single-operator** system. There are no user accounts and the
data model has no tenancy, so access control is one shared token in front of
everything rather than per-user auth.

- **Locally, nothing changes.** With `FOUNDER_OS_ACCESS_TOKEN` unset, a dev
  server behaves exactly as before, and `npm run dev` binds to `127.0.0.1` so it
  is not reachable from the rest of the network.
- **Deployed, a token is required.** A production server with no token set
  refuses to serve and explains why. This app can read your inboxes, send mail
  as you, and store a Stripe key, so a missing secret fails loudly rather than
  serving all of that to anyone with the URL.

Set it, then open the app and enter the same value once:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32     # put the result in FOUNDER_OS_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Scripts and agents can present it as a header instead:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $FOUNDER_OS_ACCESS_TOKEN" https://your-app/api/connections
```

Inbound webhooks (`/api/webhooks/…`) stay reachable without it, since third
parties cannot present your token. They carry their own secrets, so set
`MANYCHAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` if you use the ManyChat ingest.

## Deploying with Docker

This fork ships a **production-ready, multi-stage Dockerfile**. The final image
runs as a non-root user, ships production dependencies only (no
devDependencies), and never bakes secrets into image layers.

### Build

```bash
docker build -t founder-os .
```

### Run

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 4100:4100 -v founder-os-data:/app/data founder-os
```

| Flag | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `--env-file .env` | Injects all credentials at runtime (never baked into the image) |
| `-p 4100:4100` | Expose the app on port 4100 |
| `-v founder-os-data:/app/data` | Persist the SQLite database across container restarts |

The database seeds itself on first touch, so the first request populates a
fresh volume automatically.

### Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in only what you need. The app will
start without any keys and report honest "not configured" status for each
missing connector. See **Configuration** below for the full list.

> **Important:** Never bake `.env` into the image. The `.dockerignore` excludes
> it from the build context, and credentials should always be passed at runtime
> via `--env-file` or your orchestrator's secret management.

### Health check

The image includes a built-in `HEALTHCHECK` that probes `http://localhost:4100/`
every 30 seconds. Orchestrators (Docker Swarm, ECS, Kubernetes) will
automatically use it for readiness checks.

## Deploying to Railway

1. Create a Railway project and point it at this repo.
2. Set the build command to `npm run build` and the start command to `npm start`
   (the app serves on the `PORT` Railway provides).
3. **Set `FOUNDER_OS_ACCESS_TOKEN`** to a fresh random value (see **Access
   control** above). The app will not serve without it.
4. Add a database service and any connector credentials as environment variables
   in the Railway dashboard.
5. Deploy. G-Brain runs as a companion service and is referenced by URL from the
   app's environment.

## Note on the demo data

This is a demo build. All names, companies, clients, financial figures, and
social numbers are **placeholder data**. Nothing here is real.
